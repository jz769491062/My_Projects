## TravelLangHelper (ITP 341 Final Project)   
#### Author: Zihan Zhu   

This app was designed to provide expedient travel-related service to the user, including text translation,     
quick facts about countries, and location of a country on Google Map. It also contains a quiz that tests the user's knowledge about countries.  
Quiz data can be configured locally in app\src\main\assets\quiz.json.

Used REST Countries API, Google Maps API, and Yandex Translate API. Used Volley to request the JSON data from the APIs.
