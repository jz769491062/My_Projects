## TravelHelper (ITP 342 Final Project Fall 2019)   
#### Author: Zihan Zhu   

This app was designed to provide quick travel-related services to the user, including text translation,     
city weather, quick facts about countries, and location of a country on Google Map.

Used REST Countries API, Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API, and Yandex Translate API.   
In the text translation page, the user can also choose to zoom in the traslated text so the foreigners could easily see the translated text.     
The user can choose to add a city he/she searched to the list of cities and remove a city from the list. The list of cities are stored locally in mycity.plist. From the printed program output you can see the path that the plist is in.
